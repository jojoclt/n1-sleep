"""
To classify between N1 and non-N1 sleep stages based on the criteria you provided, you can follow these steps:

Load the EEG data using pyedflib or another library.
Apply a bandpass filter to extract the frequency range of interest (e.g. 0.5-30 Hz).
Segment the data into epochs of a fixed duration (e.g. 30 seconds).
For each epoch, calculate the following features:
Power spectral density (PSD) in different frequency bands (e.g. delta, theta, alpha, beta).
Low-Amplitude Mixed Frequency (LAMF) as the percentage of time with amplitude < 20 uV and frequency > 10 Hz.
Presence of Vertex Sharp Waves (VSW) as the percentage of time with sharp waves > 50 uV and duration < 70 ms.
Presence of Slow Eye Movements (SEM) as the percentage of time with eye movements < 30 uV and frequency < 3 Hz.
For each epoch, check if the following criteria are met:
Alpha power < 10% of total power.
LAMF > 50%.
If Alpha power < 10%, score N1 if any of the following are present:
EEG activity in the range of 4-7 Hz.
Vertex Sharp Waves.
Slow Eye Movements.
Count the number of epochs that meet the criteria for N1 and non-N1 sleep stages.
If the majority of epochs meet the criteria for N1 and there is no evidence of any other sleep stages, classify the epoch as N1. Otherwise, classify the epoch as non-N1.
Here is some example Python code to implement this algorithm:"""

              'theta': (4, 8),
              'alpha': (8, 12),
              'beta': (12, 30)}

# Define the epoch duration and overlap
epoch_dur = 30  # seconds
overlap = 0.5   # fraction of epoch duration

# Calculate the number of epochs

n_epochs = int(np.floor((n_samples - epoch_samples) / step_samples) + 1)

# Initialize the classification matrix

# Loop over epochs and classify based on criteria
for i in range(n_epochs):
    # Extract epoch data
    start = i * step_samples
    end = start + epoch_samples
    epoch = eeg_data[start:end]

    psd = {}
    for name, (fmin, fmax) in freq_bands.items():
        freqs, psd[name] = signal.welch(epoch, fs=fs, nperseg=epoch_samples)

    lamf = np.mean(np.logical_and(epoch < 20, freqs > 10))

    sem = np.mean(np.logical_and(epoch < 30, freqs < 3))

    # Check criteria for N1
    if psd['alpha'] < 0.1 * np.sum(list(psd.values())):
        if np.any(np.logical_and(freqs >= 4, freqs <= 7)):

            classif[i] = 1
    elif lamf > 0.5:
        classif[i] = 0

# Count the number of epochs classified as N1 and non-N1
n_n1 = np.sum(classif == 1)
n_non_n1 = np.sum(classif == 0)

# Classify based on majority vote
if n_n1 > n_non_n1 and n_n1 > 0.5 * n_epochs:
    print('N1')
